# UnitySpout-Textures

![](../img/spout-screenshot.jpg)

This example is based on the tutorial [Spout for Unity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iIwcqgAPVWI) on Windows 10. 

It makes use of [KlakSpout](https://github.com/keijiro/KlakSpout) and [Touch Designer](https://www.derivative.ca/).

It explores mapping textures generated in Touch Designer to Quads placed in Unity.
